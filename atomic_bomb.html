<h1> HOW DOES A ATOMIC BOMB WORKS </h1>
A atomic bomb works on the basis of fission ,
a neutron is fired at a very high speed directly into the nucleus of the atom
triggering the atom to split into two different parts , during this process
a massive amount of energy is released . This process encourages the split atoms 
to fire neutrons on other atoms too.
